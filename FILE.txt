Can't believe that we have inched one mile ahead in our journey of love and togetherness.
I think exactly at this time one year ago , you were pleading  me for being together and it was a strict NO from me.
I don't know what charm you have.You so magically changed my mind the next day.And the next day,sorry to scare you with so many messages.
And we started this awesome voyage.There was cool breeze,pleasant weather and loving moments.There were storms as well.
Thanks for bearing with my mood swings.I know I still have childish mentality and I thik God has made ou mature enough to handle me.
I love you re.Forgive me for hurting you so many times.But I won't leave my pagalpanti.That's for sure.Iam not a creative writer, still tried my best.
Never ever leave my hand.PLEEAASSSEEEE.....

LOVE YOU
Your    chutki,
